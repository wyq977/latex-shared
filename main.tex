\title{\LaTeX\ Project Management}

To be consistent for most \LaTeX\ projects,
I choose AOS's preprint version as the default, please check
\url{https://vtex-soft.github.io/texsupport.ims-aos/} for more details.

The references are managed externally by Zotero and BBT,
exported to BibTex format, then included via \verb|natbib|.

\section{Font size warnings}

Sometimes you will see warnings like
\begin{Verbatim}
	LaTeX Font Warning: Font shape `OML/cmm/m/it' in size <5.5> not available
	(Font)              size <5> substituted on input line 50.
\end{Verbatim}

It is usually solved by \verb|lmodern|, \verb|anyfontsize| and \verb|fix-cm| (which I used) packages.

\section{Formatting}

Ended up using the \verb|latexindent| that comes with MacTeX distribution.
It can be updated in TeX Live Utility.app, the default settings can be found in \verb|indent.log|:
\begin{Verbatim}
	/usr/local/texlive/2025/texmf-dist/scripts/latexindent/defaultSettings.yaml
\end{Verbatim}

To modify, I created a file \verb|~/.indentconfig.yaml| as:
\begin{Verbatim}
	# Paths to user settings for latexindent.pl
	paths:
	- ~/projects/latex-shared/latexindent.yaml
\end{Verbatim}

The file \verb|latexindent.yaml| is managed in my git repo.
Other settings: \url{https://latexindentpl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html}.

\section{Project structure}

\subsection{Shared files}

Currently, I have my files used across different \LaTeX\ saved in one
github repo where I make symbolic link so that I could use shortcuts like probability
$\PR{X}$ directly by including directly.

\subsection{Single file}

This is the default with one-file project, easy to track.

\begin{Verbatim}
	├── fig
	│   ├── plots.pdf
	├── main.bib
	├── main.tex
	├── main.pdf
	├── marco.tex             % All my collected macros
	├── custom-style.cls/def/sty/bst
\end{Verbatim}

\subsection{Multi-files}

Below is a larger \LaTeX\ with different chapters:

\begin{Verbatim}
	├── chapters
	│   ├── 01-blabla.tex
	├── fig
	│   ├── R/Python.pdf
	│   ├── TikZ.tex
	│   ├── TikZ.pdf
	│   ├── Asymptote.asy
	│   ├── Asymptote.pdf
	├── main.bib
	├── main.tex
	├── main.pdf
	├── marco.tex             % All my collected macros
	├── custom-style.cls/def/sty/bst
\end{Verbatim}

\section{Plotting}

\subsection{Take-home messages}

\begin{itemize}
	\item w:h = 4:3
	\item w = 2.8in: <= 0.45 of the linewidth
	\item no scaling
	\item some white space or hfill to avoid flushing the plots
\end{itemize}

Why all the troubles? This is just to solve the problem:
there should be no scaling involved from the included figures
to the \LaTeX\ document so that the font size (e.g. 8) in
figures produced by R/Python will also be 8 in final pdf.
If not, there might be some scaling, you never know!

\begin{table}[ht]
	\centering
	\caption{linewidth of aos preprint}
	\begin{tabular}{ll}
		\toprule
		unit & length                                  \\
		\midrule
		in   & \printinunitsof{in}\prntlen{\linewidth} \\
		cm   & \printinunitsof{cm}\prntlen{\linewidth} \\
		pt   & \printinunitsof{pt}\prntlen{\linewidth} \\
		bp   & \printinunitsof{bp}\prntlen{\linewidth} \\
		\bottomrule
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

To be consistent about the unit used in different plotting, \emph{inch}
is used mainly due to matplotlib.
Another thing to note that 1 in is 72.27 pt while other is 72 pt,
which is another thing to note in TikZ.

However, the TikZ did not output a pdf file at 2.8x2.1in despite explicit specification.
No solution is found so I will stick to R for the time being.

Between subfigure, a small spacing is added. Please check the
document source code.

\begin{table}[ht]
	\centering
	\caption{Suggested width and height in inches for aos document}
	\begin{tabular}{lcc}
		\toprule
		            & width & height \\
		\midrule
		Single plot & 5.6   & 4.2    \\
		Two plots   & 2.8   & 2.1    \\
		\bottomrule
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

	\includegraphics{scatterplot-tikz.pdf}
	\caption{TikZ, exact physical size, no scaling.}

\section{Mathematical notation}

It has always been a hassle to organise mathematical notation across different sources,
in fact, I would go so far as to argue that this is the most annoying thing
when one starts reading a book or an article.

However, there \textit{must be} some notational conflicts beyond primary school
simply due to the fact that the limited number of alphabets (\textbf{26}).
For example, ``$\mathbb{E}$'' might be energy in physics
while it could refer to expectation or scores in probability.

Another difficulty is that the authors often assume some familiarity in the
topics
\emph{also} I am expected to read in some logical or chronological order.
In reality, I am constantly jumping back and forth between one literature to
another.

\begin{align*}
	\Af, \Bf, \Cf, \Df, \Ef, \Ff, \Gf, \Hf, \Jf, \Kf, \Lf, \Mf, \Nf, \Of, \Pf,
	\Qf, \Rf, \Sf, \Tf, \Uf, \Vf, \Wf, \Xf, \Yf, \Zf      \\
	\Ac, \Bc, \Cc, \Dc, \Ec, \Fc, \Gc, \Hc, \Ic, \Jc, \Kc, \Lc, \Mc, \Nc, \Oc,
	\Pc, \Qc, \Rc, \Sc, \Tc, \Uc, \Vc, \Wc, \Xc, \Yc, \Zc \\
	\Ak, \Bk, \Ck, \Dk, \Ek, \Fk, \Gk, \Hk, \Ik, \Jk, \Kk, \Lk, \Mk, \Nk, \Ok,
	\Pk, \Qk, \Rk, \Sk, \Tk, \Uk, \Vk, \Wk, \Xk, \Yk, \Zk
\end{align*}
$$
	\arginf, \argsup, \argmax, \argmin, \conv
$$

This stackexchange answer: \url{https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/58124}
is probably the most comprehensive answer to which fonts are shown in \LaTeX.

\begin{tabular}{ccl}
	\textbf{Symbol} & \textbf{Usage} & \textbf{Comments}                                 \\
	$\Bf$           & \verb|\*f|     & blackboard bold except \verb|\If| due to conflict \\
	$\Bc$           & \verb|\*c|     & calligraphic font                                 \\
	$\Bk$           & \verb|\*k|     & Fraktur font                                      \\
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Choose the notations and shortcuts wisely}

I am not even talking about the difference due to differences in fonts and italic or roman.
It is just a very sad thing that we don't even have a unified way of saying probability is just sad.
Take probability for example and return to the most basic case of tossing a
coin
where the sample space is $\Ac = \{H, T\}$. I have come across:

\begin{align*}
	P() \quad \mathrm{P}() \quad \mathrm{Pr}() \quad \mathsf{P}() \quad
	\mathbf{Prob}().
\end{align*}
